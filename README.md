# Analytical Hierarchy Process Decision Tool

## Overview

This project implements a web application for the selection of mining methods for conceptual mining projects. The tool uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on Saaty's methodology to assist professionals in evaluating and comparing different mining options. The application facilitates decision-making in the early stages of mining projects by allowing users to input criteria and options, perform pairwise comparisons using intuitive slider controls, and generate a priority vector that reflects the best choices economically and technically. The tool is part of the Mafmine software suite for economic analyses of mining projects.

## Features

- **AHP-Based Evaluation:** Employs the Analytical Hierarchy Process to systematically compare and prioritize alternatives based on user-defined criteria, supporting robust decision-making across diverse applications.
- **Intuitive Interface:** User-friendly design with slider buttons for manipulating matrices and performing pairwise comparisons.
- **Flexible Project Management:** Enables users to name criteria and options, assign display symbols, and export projects as JSON. Projects can be resumed from local storage or imported from a JSON file.
- **Decision Support:** Provides a clear presentation of results through a priority vector to support early-stage project decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - Vue.js (utilizing Vue CLI for project setup)
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - vue-router
  - vuex
  - vue-meta
  - lodash
  - ESLint with eslint-plugin-vue for code quality

## How to Use

1. **Access the application interface.**
2. **Input your criteria and options:** Name each criterion and option, and assign a representative symbol.
3. **Perform pairwise comparisons:**  
   - **Stage 1:** Compare each option against the defined criteria using slider controls.  
   - **Stage 2:** Define the importance of each criterion.
4. **Review the results:** The application calculates and presents a priority vector based on the AHP method.
5. **Manage your projects:** Export your current project to JSON, resume saved projects from local storage, or import a previously exported project.

## Architecture

The application is designed as a modular and scalable single-page application (SPA) built using Vue.js. Its architecture allows for easy expansion and maintenance, with a clear separation between the user interface, state management, and data handling. The use of JSON for project export/import and local storage for persistence ensures seamless project management.
